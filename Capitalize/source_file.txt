While focusing on statistics and analytics at my university,
I worked in the financial sector through an internship at a major multinational firm. 
My education and this tactical experience helped me develop technical capabilities in data engineering and science.
i have consistently proven my ability to meet deadlines and achieve project objectives, solve mission-critical problems and prioritize crucial tasks while maintaining the high standards expected of my role.
I am currently seeking a position in an established data science firm to further my career goals.
